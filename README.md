Motivated and self-taught entry-level Data Analyst with a strong command of data tools, including advanced 
Excel, SQL, and Power BI. I leverage Excel for comprehensive data cleaning, measurement, and creating 
analytical dashboards to communicate trends and insights, as demonstrated in my current Customer 
Feedback Analyst and previous RTM Analyst roles. My proficiency extends to Power Query for efficient data 
consolidation and normalization. Through various hands-on projects (detailed below), I have a proven ability 
to analyze diverse datasets, uncover key insights, and support data-driven decision-making, excelling in data 
cleaning, visualization, and reporting. Backed by certifications in data analytics, including a Lean Six Sigma 
(Yellow Belt), and a track record of independent learning, I am committed to continuous growth and 
delivering results in the field.
